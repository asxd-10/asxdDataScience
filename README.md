### Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* Using Jupyter notebook from Anaconda is recommended. You may use other data visualization tools like Tableau for reference.

### Project Motivation
This is a project for the Udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist program. I chose FM 2020 from Kaggle as personally, being an avid football fan, it was an intriguing topic to explore. 

The key questions answered in the data analysis project are: 

1. Can the position of players be predicted from the given player attributes?
2. Which attributes influence the best position for a player?
3. Which attributes have no correlation with a player's position?


### File Descriptions
[dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/ajinkyablaze/football-manager-data/download) - This is a 37 MB file available on Kaggle and comprises the entire Football Manager 2020 database of players.It contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It does not contain missing values.

The attached file to this reposiory [FMproject.ipynb](https://github.com/asxd-10/asxdDataScience/blob/master/FMproject.ipynb) contains the entire code for the data analysis. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions posed above. The code contains appropriate sections and descriptions of the process used.

### Conclusion and Inference
The important insights and findings obtained from the data analysis have been described in this [article].
